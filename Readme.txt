The project 
https://github.com/MessiahSolutions/TimeLineDashboard

Is underconstruction and should have many cool innovative solutions and reallife helpers. 
A documentation folder with the intentions of the software will be added in the next months. 

----------
To run the project properly the file TimeLineDashboard.sln
Should be opened with Visual Studio 2019 (or any later versions..)
This file currently represents the server side backend of the timeline dashboard application. 

To open the front-end project  -- You can use any IDE 
I recommend opening the folder "Dashboard-FrontEnd" with visual studio code (code.visualstudio.com)
(!!!)  After opening the folder do not forget to run "NPM Install"  
This is because the Dashboard-FrontEnd\node_modules is not commited nor hosted as part of the solution in github. 

More guidelines, application usage and other documentation will be added later on during the development
